To be fair those butts are weak sauce.
Dear @Gillette marketing team (+ your brand ad agency): pls stop promoting toxic masculinity, and start speaking to actual core masculine truths. Like it’s ok to be insecure. It’s ok to be sensitive. It’s okay to have feelings. It’s ok to be human. Etc. #GilleteAd
@Gillette Not one single man in this comment section can tell me what’s bad about this ad. NOT ONE.
RT @ What is so offensive about the ad? Which part offended you? The part about not grabbing a woman’s butt? The part about not verbally harassing women? The part about teaching kids not to bully?

RT @ The amount of people who are pissed at the Gillette commercial? I’m truly shook! You’re missing the whole point, it’s not implying that all men are inherently bad. It’s encouraging men to stop the perpetuation of toxicity that exists within the culture.

@SephF @juhotee @Gillette Masculinity in itself isn’t toxic, but CAN be. You haven’t heard of toxic femininity because (honestly) it isn’t displayed a lot in our society.  This commercial is highlighting the masculinity that IS toxic in some men, and talking to the bystanders (not-all-men-ists).

Your masculinity is toxic, by the way here's our logo on 16 girls asses.
@goodlimediner @octoseven @prophiphop @Gillette yeah see personally i reject the idea that boys being physical and wrestling is always negative thing. The idea that physicality is always a net-negative is a perfect example of how masculinity has been diminished and redefined by our culture.

I hunt, split logs with an ax, fight for justice, hold the door woman or a man. I agree with @terrycrews, It is time for men to be better &amp; hold each other accountable. #TheBestMenCanBe is not being a pushover; it is being strong in the right ways and for the right reasons.
@Caitlinh24 @GotThisGame @brianschatz @Gillette It’s been fast and furious, thank you for being a grammar nazi. You are literally Hitler.
@BenFromBrisbane @Gillette Aside from that the message is a good message, but many people are cynical about being preached to when the end goal is to sell more product and make more profit. Try preaching to your friends who hold different views than you... it rarely goes down well regardless of the message

So like I said, don’t compare my race to justify reason behind someone being a nasty human being
RT @ Guys, please calm down.  It's not like #Gillette's asking you to shave your whole body, wear makeup, perfume, high heels; not eat too much in public and not be above or below a certain weight...Right?
RT @ If yall really think this Gillette commercial is coming at you, It's just further proving just how fragile your own sense of masculinity actually is. A commercial about kindness and respect can make you feel less like a man just by watching it? Like huuhhh?

@Lawrence @Gillette I thought it was a gorgeous ad.
@sarahmorgan @Gillette @ProcterGamble Well, yeah. The entire ad was disingenuous. They're cashing in on an idealogy. They don't actually give a damn about changing anything. As we speak women are paying more money for pink Gillette razors then men are for thier blue ones. Why? Theres no difference between the two.
Presenting: the wrong message for the wrong brand.  Men liked your story @Gillette   Your old story. Past tense is a b****  #selfsabotage #GilletteAd #Gillette #BrandStrategy

My opinion on the Gillette commercial is that if you look at it as a whole it seems well-intentioned, it's the beginning that people have a problem with. The phrase toxic masculinity leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
@TomiLahren @Gillette Jesus this is almost as bad as her saying “not all men...” like no where in the ad did it once say “all men”. No, they applaud healthy masculinity, helping one another, and treating one another as people. Like Jesus intended (Christian example since you use them often)

I think you're more of an idiot than you let on? You actually think a YouTube video that a bored man put together in 30 minutes is the same thing as a professional Gillette commercial? Listen boo, not here to change your mind, just here to make you look like a dumbass. Next 😘
@peta It's the normalisation of behaviour like THIS that @Gillette was rallying against in their new commercial. Shame on you PETA. Also treat animals ethically but act morally depraved in front of women? Is that your new message??
@TheSun I blame Gillette!
@mrfavus I'm recorded my Gillette thing and getting my cohort to do an animated thing to go along with it.
@SuzieSzabo2 I'm sure once all the toxic males have watched the Gillette add a few times things will improve. I mean imagine the perpetrators of these crimes will be clean shaven blokes, defo not big religious beardies. Seriously that is shocking MSM outcry?

@ABCthedrum Think Bridie is spot on. The ad is brand building. For every outrage customer they’ve lost, they’ll gain ten. Don’t boycott just hold P&amp;G accountable. Follow what they’re really doing about changing culture - not just for Gillette but for all of their brands.
